Abstract

This learning tool provides users with an interactive and engaging way of understanding more about the nature of learning algorithms, specifically, the genetic algorithm. Users become more familiar and comfortable with something that may have previously been inaccessible or intimidating. The game consists of a set of cannons that represent the population in a genetic algorithm. Using sliders, correlating to specific variables of the algorithm and the landscape, the user is able to adjust and experiment to see real-time effects through a hands-on and highly visual learning experience. This active, real-time feedback reinforces learning and solidifies understanding of the genetic algorithm - its structure, limitations, and applications.
